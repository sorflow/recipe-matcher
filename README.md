Recipe Matcher 

My old professor from Google, Joon Lee, over a great conversation in our messages asking for guidance and help for ideas on projects, he gave me a great idea to make a simple app in Java to make a recipe app that write an app that takes a set of recipes and a set of items in your fridge. Recipes are a dictionary of recipes names where each recipe has a list of ingredient names. The items in the fridge is a list. Your program should output the recipes you can make from the items in your fridge. I don't know how to make a professional readme LOLLLLLLLLL but this will be an updated project I work on and try to improve with the knowledge I get from my university and peers. Thank you for looking at a beta. LOL enjoy!
